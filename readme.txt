Easily connects a WordPress website to a First Data Payeezy Payment Page for accepting Credit Card donations. No SSL required.

== Description ==

Plugin creates a shortcode that when placed in the Page or a Post, generates a donation form for a Payeezy Payment Page. The published form includes:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email Address
* Comment
* The amount to donate. User making the donation can either pick a predefined amount to donate or enter a custom amount.
* User can also choose to make their donation monthly, on an automatic recurring basis, by checking a box. 

Once they have entered their choices, they click the "Donate Now" button. They are then redirected to the secure Payeezy payment form where they finish entering their information including credit card number, expiration date, and security code. The user then clicks "Pay with your credit card" and the payment is made. Once the transaction is complete, the user is provided a receipt. They can then click a button and be redirected back to the original website.
